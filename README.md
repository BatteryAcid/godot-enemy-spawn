# Enemy Spawn and Sync  

An example of how to spawn and sync mobs, NPCs, or anything you want to sync between connected players.  

- See tutorial: https://youtu.be/Sc_pP_nKSL8  

I also cover how to remove the spawned mobs after a set time and how to prevent additional spawns after it's been triggered. This can be helpful if you want to spawn temporary mobs or things like potions, power-ups, or anything with limited use.



# Basic Multiplayer Version

This is a fork of Brackeys first Godot project with an added basic multiplayer implementation. 

Uses MultiplayerSynchronizer, MultiplayerSpawner, and RPCs to sync player position, animation, and the moving platform in the game.
